Matrix Multiply Example Application Readme
Revised February 11, 2011 for Elastic Phoenix


1. Application Overview
-----------------------

Matrix Multiply application computes the product of 2 matrices
of the same size.


2. Provided Files
-----------------

matrix_multiply.c: The version of the file that uses the MapReduce engine
Makefile: Compiles the application
README: This file


3. Running the Application
--------------------------

Run 'make' to compile the application. 

./matrix_multiply <side of matrix> - MapReduce Version
side of matrix: Specifies the length of the side of the matrix (both matrices are of the same size) (required)

The application generates two matrices (of all 1's, for easy result verification), then multiplies then and displays the sum of all the numbers in the resulting matrix.
